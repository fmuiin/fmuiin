## Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at W.Media Global, where I specialize in building web solutions with **Laravel**, **WordPress**, custom plugins, and **VueJS**. My top technical skills are in Laravel, WordPress, and VueJS—these are the frameworks and platforms I love working with most.

### 🚩 Flagship Project
One of my proudest achievements is developing the ‘Ticketing App’ for W.Media. I built the entire ticketing system—frontend and backend—handling everything from guest data entry to ticket issuance and converting attendees into leads via scanning.
